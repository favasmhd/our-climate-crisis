            <h2>Chapter 1: What is Climate Change?</h2>
            <p>Climate change is more than just a scientific term. It's a story that has unfolded over centuries, shaped by the forces of nature and increasingly by human activity. Once, Earth’s climate was largely stable, with fluctuations happening slowly over millennia. But now, over just a few decades, we are witnessing dramatic shifts in weather patterns and temperatures.</p>
            <p>At its core, climate change refers to long-term changes in global temperatures and weather patterns. These changes used to occur naturally, but human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels for energy and deforestation, have accelerated the process. We now face rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and more frequent extreme weather events.</p>
            <p>The planet is warming because of the <strong>greenhouse effect</strong>, a phenomenon where gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O) trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. While these gases occur naturally, human activities have increased their concentration dramatically. Since the late 19th century, the global average temperature has risen by more than 1°C. It may sound small, but even this seemingly minor change has significant impacts.</p>
            <p>As we delve into the science behind climate change, we must ask: How did we get here? And more importantly, what can we do to slow it down before it’s too late? In the following chapters, we’ll explore the data, the trends, and the real-world effects of a changing climate.</p>
